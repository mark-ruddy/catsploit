// - Write a revshell payload that works on legacy systems like Metasploitable2(nc mkifo, done)
- Write a full test suite and refactor as much as possible at this early stage, remove all TODOs
  // - Write initial lib tests
  - Write initial CLI tests
- Improve user CLI experience, add the "use X(1)" functionality, make tables look better for "show payloads", etc
