// - Write a revshell payload that works on legacy systems like Metasploitable2(nc mkifo, done)
// - Write a full test suite and refactor as much as possible at this early stage, remove all TODOs
  // - Write initial lib tests
  // - Write initial CLI tests
// - Improve user CLI experience, add the "use X(1)" functionality, make tables look better for "show payloads", etc
  // - print module stats on boot
  // - use 1 functionality
  // - make `help` display properly
- Refactoring
  - go through all TODOs and fix up

Future:
- info module_path doesn't print the options, not super necessary but a good to have in future
- search command
